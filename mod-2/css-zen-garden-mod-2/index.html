            <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags,
                <br>incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
            
            <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved

            <h3>SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h3>
        <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to
            <br>excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the
            <br>existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into
            <br>this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed is
            <br>the external CSS file. Yes, really.</p>
        
        <p>CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document.
            <br>The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by
            <br>demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of
            <br>those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have
            <br>contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>

            <h3>PARTICIPATION</h3>
            
            <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so
                <br>strong CSS skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented well
                <br>enough that even CSS novices can use them as starting points. Please see the CSS 
                <br>Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS.</p>
            
             <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML.This
                <br>may seem daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the
                <br>listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.</p>
            
            <p>Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you have 
                <br>completed your masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) 
                <br>upload your CSS file to a web server under your control. Send us a link to an 
                <br>archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will 
                <br>download it and place it on our server.</p> 
                
                <h3>BENEFITS</h3>
            <p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to 
                <br>showing people how amazing CSS really can be. This site serves as equal parts 
                <br>inspiration for those working on the web today, learning tool for those who will 
                <br>be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.</p>

            <h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>  
            <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should 
            <br>be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be 
            <br>provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSS and not the 
            <br>latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real 
            <br>requirement we have is that your CSS validates.</p>
            
            <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have 
            <br>implemented CSS by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see 
            <br>fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer 
            <br>number of user agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in 
            <br>mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform.
            <br>That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at 
            <br>least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by 
            <br>over 90% of the population).</p>
            
            <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please 
            <br>keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and 
            <br>interesting visual themes to your work. We’re well past the point of needing
            <br>another garden-related design.</p>
            
            <p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright 
            <br>on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see submission guidelines), but we 
            <br>ask you release your CSS under a Creative Commons license identical to the 
            <br>one on this site so that others may learn from your work.</p>
